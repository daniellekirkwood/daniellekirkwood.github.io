## Welcome 

**Good to see you!**

If you're here, you've come to take a look around the repo.

There are a couple of files that make the website work. We're using GitHub pages and I set it up following [the instructions here](https://daniellekirkwood.github.io/content/setup.html).

<hr />

### Content

The content found on the site is contained in the Content folder. The title of each page relates directly to its content. Naming conventions are few; lower case, useful... That's about it

<hr />

### Making changes

  If there's anything missing from the site, go ahead and raise an [New Topic Request issue](https://github.com/daniellekirkwood/daniellekirkwood.github.io/issues/new/choose)
  
  If there's anything that needs changing, raise an [amendment request here](https://github.com/daniellekirkwood/daniellekirkwood.github.io/issues/new/choose)

Remember, I'm human. Everything on this page is a draft. As my understanding of PM practices and the world in general grows, so will the topics and the views in them.
