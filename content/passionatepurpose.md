### Goal
Inspire others towards the desired outcome.

### By
Allow the audience to breath in your energy, your passion, and your vision.

By creating the opportunity for inspiration this way, you're creating space for folks to be intrinsically motivated and thus the drive to change will be easier and much more powerful.

Set your intention clearly and purposefully using power verbs; your passion will shine in all you do.
