## Score
Currently trialling using a 4-point score for each category to simplify ordering a list.

Each category can be given a number from "1" to "4" where "1" is Extremely Low and "4" is Extremely High.

An ideal project would score 4,4,4,1 to a total of 13.

I'm thinking to change the "E" form Effort to Ease so that the max score would be 4 across the board and calculations made are simpler. However, for now "13" is the 'sweet spot' and we'll see how we go...
