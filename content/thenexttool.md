| LEAP OF FAITH ASSUMPTION The most critical assumption you are making about your idea at this time for which you have the least amount of evidence. |               |  |  |
|  | *LOOP* ⌄  | *LOOP* ⌄    | *LOOP* ⌄   |
| **HYPOTHESIS **A specific, measurable description of your Leap of Faith Assumption.  *If we do* **X***, then* **Y%** *of customers will behave in way* **Z** |       |   |   |
| **EXPERIMENT **Build the absolute minimum required to test your hypothesis, as fast as possible.  *Don't just confirm,* **learn***. include ways to capture surprises, as well as real behavior important to your idea.* |  |    |     |
| **BEHAVIOR **Action speaks louder than words.**  ***Measure real customer behaviors associated with your hypothesis. Encourage 'currency' exchange when possible. No surveys!* |    |       |       |
| **TARGET METRIC **Commit to a minimum success threshold.**  **Choose a number high enough to get you and your team excited if true, and relative to the experiment you are conducting. |     |        |                          |
| Run your experiment as quickly and frugally as possible.     | Launch your experiment   | Launch your experiment   | Launch your experiment   |
| **ACTUAL RESULTS **What actually happened? ** **Record the actual metrics generated during your experiment, paying close attention to new behaviors and surprises. |                          |                          |   |
| **WHY? **What behaviors did you observe? ** **Record the observable behavior, live feedback and reactions you witnessed first hand, which influenced the actual results. |                          |                          |                          |
| **NEW INSIGHTS **Insights change the way we think about our customers or your idea. ** **Record the new information you generated during this experiment, as well as unique observations you made in the field. |   |   |    |
| What new evidence did you generate? | Discuss what you learned | Discuss what you learned | Discuss what you learned |
| **DECISION **Take your next step - move forward.**  **Look for a trend in your evidence over time. No single experiment holds all the answers. Iterate? Persevere? Pivot? |                          |                          |                          |
| Is your decision based on the evidence you generated?        | Go to next loop ⤴        | Go to next loop ⤴        | Go to next loop ⤴        |
