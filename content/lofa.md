- An **assumption** is a belief that exist without proof.
- A **Leap of faith assumptions** is a belief that are the most critical to the success. Beliefs that, if not true, would bring the whole platform down. 


LOFAs are the riskiest elements of any plan, everything else depends on them.

LOFAs should be relative to your specific solution idea and are defined as "the assumptions that are most crucial for a thing to succeed" and "have not been proven true elsewhere". 


**An example:**

When AirBnB first started, they identified that in order for their business to work, 2 things _must_ be true. Those were:
1. People had to be willing to let strangers rent a room/floor space in their house for a short period of time.
2. People had to be willing to rent a room/floor space in a house from strangers.

Only one of these customer assumptions is a true LOFA. It's number 2.

Number 1 is not a true LOFA as the concept of Bed&Breakfasts already shows that to be true in a similar enough environment that they could make a less risky assumption it would apply to their new business too.


Part of [Rapid Experimentation](./content/rapidexperimentation.md) theory is testing your LOFAs as quickly and as cheaply as possible to ensure that your idea 'has legs'. 

In the case of AirBnB, they created a website that promoted one room, and one floor space, in San Francisco during a big event. They had so much interest from people wanting to stay in their own apartment, that they concluded the idea would be successful and continued to build it to a full-product.
